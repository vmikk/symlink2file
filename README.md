# symlink2file

## Overview

`symlink2file` is a command-line tool designed for Unix-like operating systems. 
Its primary function is to replace symbolic links (symlinks) in a specified directory 
with the actual files they point to. This tool may be useful in scenarios where symlinks 
need to be converted to regular files, such as for archival purposes, 
simplifying file structures, or preparing data for environments that do not support symlinks.
